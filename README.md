### Prerequisites

1. Composer PHP package manager [https://getcomposer.org]
2. PHP 7.4 or higher
3. MySQL/MariaDB database

### Installation

1)Install Composer PHP package manager [https://getcomposer.org]

    'host' => 'localhost',
    'username' => 'your_username',
    'password' => 'your_password',
]
```

6) Start the development server:

php fortress run
```

Or visit via traditional web server:
```
http://localhost/fortress
```

## Architecture

fortress follows a clean MVC architecture with additional security layers:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/        # Request handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Framework core
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ console/       # CLI command system
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exceptions/    # Custom exception classes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces/    # Contracts and interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/    # Security and request middleware
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database/      # Database layer with security
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/             # Presentation layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bootstrap/         # Application bootstrap files
```

## Security Features

### üîí SQL Injection Protection
- Parameterized queries with PDO
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure database connection handling

### üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting & Throttling
```php
// Configure in routes.php
$router->middleware(new RateLimitMiddleware(100, 60))  // 100 requests/minute
       ->middleware(new ThrottleMiddleware(1));         // 1 second between requests
```

### üèóÔ∏è Dependency Injection
```php
// Interface binding
App::bind(UserRepositoryInterface::class, UserRepository::class);

// Singleton registration
App::singleton(DatabaseManager::class);

// Auto-resolution
$service = App::resolve(SomeService::class);
```

## CLI Commands

Fortress includes a Laravel Artisan-like CLI system for development tasks:

### Development Server
```bash
# Start server (default: localhost:8000)
php fortress run

# Custom host and port
php fortress run 127.0.0.1:3000
php fortress run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080

# Show help
php fortress run --help
```

### Available Commands
- `run` - Start the development server with built-in PHP server

### Extending the CLI
Create new commands by implementing `CommandInterface`:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Core\Console\Commands;

class MyCommand implements CommandInterface
{
    public function execute(array $arguments)
    {
        // Your command logic here
    }
}
```

Register commands in `app/Core/Console/Console.php`.
